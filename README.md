# linear-regression-model
This project is about building the linear regression model about red wine study
in this project, we find a set of data about red wine, including 1600 samples and 12 variables (Cortez P). The twelve variables are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, quality. The original plan is to treat quality as response variables, and then the remaining 11 data as explanatory variables. However, because the quality is discrete data, after our team tried it in many ways, we found that it could not be regarded as y variable. Therefore, we let alcohol be the response variable. Then, because there are too many samples, only the first 300 data are selected. Then, use R Studio for data analysis, and find the most suitable selection model for our group.  Moreover, carry out the influential analysis on the selected model and find out several outliers that can be deleted to make the model more stationary. Furthermore, transform the final model and find the most appropriate way to improve Adjust R^2, and prediction of red wine based on useful variables.
